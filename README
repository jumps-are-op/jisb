jisb  Jisb Is a Suck-less Bar

Look at config.h and make it your dynamiclly-generated status bar!

Every block can be added using the following format:

BLK(interval, signal, blocktype, string, func, prefix, suffix)

interval -> Positive number of seconds to wait.
	If 0, only run once at startup.
signal -> Run when SIGRTMIN+signal is recived, 0 means no signal.
blocktype -> Can be one of the following:
	SH -> Execute shell string and capture it's output.
	FILE -> Read from the first line of the file.
	FUNC -> Only run `func` and ignore the string.
string -> File/sh string to read/execute.
func -> If non-NULL, will be called on the buffer,
	and if the type is not FUNC and the string is non-NULL,
	the result of the string will be passed to `func`.
prefix -> A prefix to always print before the block.
suffix -> A suffix to always print after the block.

NOTE: Strings (other than `block.string`) are always wide-character strings.
	And in C, wide-character strings are defined as `L"MYSTRING"`.
	See `wchar.h` for more information.
